## üíº **Experience**  

### **Genomics Data Scientist (PhD Intern)**  
**Regeneron Genetics Center** ‚Ä¢ Tarrytown, New York ‚Ä¢ June 2024 - August 2024  
- Employed advanced bioinformatics tools and statistical models to analyze and interpret large-scale multiomic datasets.  
- Deconvoluted proteomic data from the UK Biobank to cell-type-specific fractions to enhance understanding of immune cell types in autoimmune diseases.  
- Integrated epidemiological, immunological, and genomic data from autoimmune disorders to create custom phenotypes for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) meta-analyses.  
- Conducted comprehensive GWAS to explore the genetic underpinnings of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.  
- Presented results bi-weekly to a cross-functional team of geneticists, immunologists, and medical doctors.  

### **Graduate Research Associate**  
**University of California, Davis** ‚Ä¢ [Project Portfolio](https://oyageshio.wixsite.com/oshi-omics/projects) ‚Ä¢ September 2020 - Present  
- Built a case-control assignment algorithm for tuberculosis status, utilizing clinical, behavioral, and self-report data from over 50 variables.  
- Implemented Random Forest and Logistic Regression models to predict factors influencing active tuberculosis progression in a case-control dataset comprising over 1000 patients from rural South African clinics.  
- Performed functional annotation of pathogenic variants for the Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry Populations (CAAPA).  
- Conducted the first single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a Tuberculosis case-control cohort to identify novel variants implicated in tuberculosis progression.  

### **Teaching Assistant: Computational Genomics**  
**University of California, Davis** ‚Ä¢ September 2023 - Present  
- Collaborated with Dr. Brenna Henn in facilitating an advanced computational human genetics course for a cohort of 25 Ph.D. students, emphasizing genetic data analysis hosted on a remote server.  
- Contributed to the development of course materials to create engaging and informative lecture content and homework assignments.  
- Conducted weekly coding sessions to provide personalized guidance to students as they worked through assignments.  

### **Visiting Scholar**  
**Stellenbosch University** ‚Ä¢ Cape Town, South Africa ‚Ä¢ September 2022 - April 2023  
- Executed comprehensive data collection encompassing blood, saliva, biometric, and demographic information during an extensive 2-month fieldwork expedition to the Northern Cape Province of South Africa.  
- Developed a data pipeline for harmonizing disparate datasets, utilizing a combination of saliva barcodes and ID numbers to ensure data accuracy and integrity.
